# Your Warming World

Web app made with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) allowing users to see how temperature has changed from 1880 to 2022 at any place on the globe according to NASA's [GISTEMP](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) analysis. The map overlay shows the difference between the average temperature in the last decade and the average for the 1951-1980 reference period, giving a quick overview of where warming has been most intense in recent decades.

This is the successor to an [earlier project](https://data.buzzfeed.com/projects/climate-files/temperature.html) for BuzzFeed News, which in turn was inspired by a [2013 project](https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-we-made-your-warming-world/) for New Scientist, now defunct, made with [Chris Amico](https://github.com/eyeseast).

### Methodology/Code
The code and methods to process NASA's data NetCDF format to the files uploaded to Mapbox is in the `data` folder in the file `temperature.RmD`.
